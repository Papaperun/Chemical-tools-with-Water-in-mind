🧪 Chemical Purchase Order Script
This Python script helps automate chemical inventory tracking and generate simple purchase orders (POs) in Excel and PDF formats.

It prompts the user for daily usage, current tank levels, and maximum tank capacities of a few chemicals. Based on a user-defined lead time, it determines whether a chemical needs to be reordered and creates a PO for those that do.

📦 Features
Tracks chemical usage and estimates days left until tanks are empty.

Alerts when chemicals need reordering based on lead time.

Automatically generates:

A purchase order in .xlsx format (Excel)

A summary report in .pdf format

Simple structure for easy customization and expansion.

🚀 Getting Started
Prerequisites
You’ll need Python installed, along with the following libraries:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pandas reportlab openpyxl
🧠 reportlab is used to generate PDF files, and openpyxl is used when saving Excel files.

📋 How to Use
Run the script:

bash
Copy
Edit
python your_script_name.py
You’ll be asked to:

Enter your desired lead time in days (how far in advance you want to reorder).

Enter tank level, daily use, and maximum level for each chemical.

The script will:

Calculate the number of days remaining before the chemical runs out.

Generate a purchase order if the remaining days are less than or equal to your lead time.

Save the PO in both Excel and PDF formats with today’s date in the filename.

⚠️ Notes
If no chemical usage is reported or no chemicals need ordering on a given day, no files will be generated. This is normal, especially in real-world operations where chemical use may vary or be zero some days.

If daily usage is entered as 0, the script will skip that chemical to prevent division errors.

All inputs are expected as feet and US dollars ($) — feel free to adapt this for your own units.

🛠 Customization
This script is kept simple on purpose so it can be tailored to other industries and uses:

Chemical names and prices can be changed by editing the chemical_prices dictionary at the top of the script.

Want to use liters, gallons, or other materials? Just change the unit labels and conversion factors as needed.

The basic PDF layout can be upgraded with your company logo, address, vendor info, etc.

You can add email integration or link this script to a dashboard if you want to scale it further.

🔮 Future Improvements
Planned upgrades for better usability:

🖼 GUI Version: A graphical user interface using Tkinter, so it’s easier to use without typing into a console.

💾 Save Tank Max Levels: Add a settings system (like a JSON or config file) to store maximum tank levels, avoiding the need to retype them every time. This will improve workflow and reduce user fatigue.

📄 Example Output
Example PO line in PDF:
