## 📌 Why I Built This

As someone working in water treatment, I got tired of doing the same calculations over and over. So I automated them. This tool was written to be clear, operator-friendly, and fast to use in real situations — no fluff.

This is part of a bigger vision: building a one-stop Python toolkit for operators in the field.

Let me know if you want to change the tone, add a gif demo, or plug your socials. Once i build the GUI version, i will update this to include screenshots and GUI install instructions too. Want me to help make a screenshot or animation of the CLI version?
