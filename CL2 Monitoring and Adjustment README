# CL2 Monitoring and Adjustment Simulation

ðŸ’§ A dynamic simulation of chlorine dosing in a water treatment plant, including automated adjustments and realistic plant behavior.

## ðŸ§ª Features

- Simulates CL2 readings with realistic random fluctuations
- Automatically adjusts dose toward target residual (4.5 mg/L)
- Tracks:
  - Chlorine residual (mg/L)
  - Dose applied (lbs/day)
  - Plant flow (MGD)
- Outputs data to a clean visualization with Matplotlib

## ðŸ“ˆ Output

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

- Python 3
- Matplotlib
- Random module (for realistic fluctuation)

## ðŸš€ Future Plans

- Add GUI for operator interaction
- Real-time graph updates
- Integrate with larger SCADA simulator

## ðŸ’¡ Inspiration

Built to demonstrate automation logic and chemical feed monitoring for water utilities and SCADA simulation. Designed for hands-free simulation runs with future GUI and alert logic in mind.
